# Nodejs App for monitoring files, changes

This repo is my practice to revise Node for coding interviews.

## What we will cover?

- Analyzing the monitoring problem

- Watching and listening changes in folder

- Watching and listening changes in a specific file

## Analyzing

First, we need to read the errors in file log of a project.

Second, the problem requires a separate service Node.js runs besides the main server.
